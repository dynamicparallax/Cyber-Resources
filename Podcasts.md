| 112  | Adopting Zero Trust                     | Today, Zero Trust is a fuzzy term with more than a dozen different definitions. Any initial search for Zero Trust leads people to stumble upon technology associated with the concept, but this gives people the wrong impression and sets them off on the wrong foot in their adoption journey. Zero Trust is a concept and framework, not technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/adopting-zero-trust/id1633461773                                                                                                                   |
